# Simulation-Based Inference Introductory Notebook

Introduction to Simulation-Based Inference in the form of a jupyter/RISE notebook. Currently covers pure likelihood-free inference, approximate Bayesian computation, density-estimation likelihood-free inference and Bayesian optimization likelihood-free inference, with the first three algorithms coded up for simple single-parameter, single-observation problems.

Initially prepared for the [London Cosmology Discussion Meeting](https://londoncosmology.net/lcdm/) on December 5th, 2019, at the [Royal Astronomical Society](https://ras.ac.uk/).

Requires [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/maint-5.6/).
